            (have different places where you can store the apples, where one location has a higher chance of losing apples than others)

            collect apples -> 1st/2nd lunches -> count number of people helping -> collect those apples to the extent that the backpacks can store them -> recruit people and maybe other schools to collect apples for you

            create system to determine the number of apples that can be collected and maximum storage that can held at the school 

            collect apples on weekdays -> apple houses on weekends

            (create timing system)

            if collecting too many apples -> get caught and reset apple count with a permanent nerf
